3-Client Server Request
    GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server.

    POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.

    PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.

    PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.

    DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.

            $empInfo = ["Nour",5000,"IT",False];
            echo empInfo [0];

            echo $empInfo["Name"];
    Conditional Statements:
            if (condition 1){
                PHP Code If Condation 1 is True
            } elseif(condition 2){
                PHP Code If Condation 2 is true
            } elseif (condition 3){
                PHP Code If Condation 3 is true
            } else {
                PHP Code IF All Conditions are False
            }
    Loops:
        For:
            for (initial value; conditionl interval){
                PHP Code;
            }
        While:
            $d = 0;
            while ($d <= 10){
                PHP Code;
                $d ++;
            }
        For Each:
            $values = [Value 1, Value 2, Value 3];
            foreach($values as $val){
                echo $val;
            } 
    Function:
        function functionName(1,2){
            PHP Code;
            return $value;
        }
                function functionName(value1,value2){
